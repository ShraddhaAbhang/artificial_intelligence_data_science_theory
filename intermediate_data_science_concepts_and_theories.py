# 1. Advanced Data Manipulation

'''
1.1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handling Missing Values: Techniques like imputation (mean, median, mode), forward/backward fill, or using algorithms robust to missing data.
Outlier Detection: Methods such as Z-scores, IQR (Interquartile Range), or visual methods like box plots.
Data Transformation: Normalization, standardization, log transformations, and their impacts on machine learning models.

1.2. Feature Engineering:

Feature Creation: Creating new features from existing data (e.g., extracting date components, creating interaction features).
Feature Selection: Methods like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), feature importance from models (e.g., tree-based models), or dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA).
